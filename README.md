Sentiment analysis is the process of using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to determine the emotional tone or attitude expressed in text data.
It is commonly used to analyze opinions, reviews, social media posts, and other forms of textual content.
Key steps include:
(i)Data Collection: Gather text data from sources like social media, reviews, or surveys.
(ii)Text Preprocessing: Clean the data by removing noise (like punctuation, stopwords, and special characters) and converting text to a consistent format.
(iii)Feature Extraction: Convert text into numerical features using techniques like Bag of Words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings.
(iv)Model Training: Use machine learning algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, or deep learning models) to classify text into categories such as positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
(v)Evaluation and Interpretation: Assess the model's performance and interpret the results to understand the overall sentiment and key drivers behind it.
